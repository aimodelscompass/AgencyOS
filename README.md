# AgencyOS: The Sovereign Marketing Intern

**Turn your OpenClaw into a Senior Marketing Strategist.**

AgencyOS is a "Brain Configuration" for OpenClaw designed for agencies and freelancers. It doesn't just chat; it remembers your clients, mimics their voice, and executes complex research workflows.

## 🧠 What's Inside?

- **The Brain (`SOUL.md`):** A persona engineered to act like a Senior Strategist, not a chatbot.
- **Client Memory:** A CRM-ready folder structure to store brand guidelines and campaign history.
- **Voice Profiles:** Templates to ensure every draft sounds exactly like the client.
- **Workflow Playbooks:** Pre-structured prompts for Research and Content Repurposing.

## ⚡ Installation (5 Seconds)

Don't reinstall OpenClaw. Just give it a brain transplant.

1. **Clone or Download this repo.**
2. **Copy the files to your OpenClaw workspace:**
   ```bash
   cp -r agency-os/workspace/* ~/.openclaw/workspace/
   ```
3. **Restart OpenClaw.**

## 📂 Structure
